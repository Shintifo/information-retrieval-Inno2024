    "### Task 1: Archiving Virtual Artifacts - Preserving a Digital Museum\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.0.1. Task Description\n",
    "Imagine you are a data archivist working to preserve artifacts from the **Smithsonian Institution's digital collection**. Your job is to download, store, and manage different types of data (such as images, videos, and documents) to ensure they can be accessed later without repeated downloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the [Smithsonian Institution Collections](https://www.si.edu/snapshot) as your source of artifacts. You are tasked with building a caching system that can store downloaded files in a structured way and retrieve them as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tasks:\n",
    "1. `fetch_artifact() -> bool`: Download content from the Smithsonian's collection page based on a provided URL. The method should return `True` if the download is successful, or `False` if the download fails. This method will handle errors like network issues and non-existent pages gracefully.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. `store_artifact(directory: str = \"artifact_cache\") -> None`: Save the content of the artifact (text, image, etc.) in a local file system. Each artifact must be stored in its own unique file based on its URL. If the content is already present in the directory, it should not overwrite existing files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `retrieve_artifact(directory: str = \"artifact_cache\") -> bool`: Load an artifact from local storage using its URL. This ensures that the content is cached correctly and avoids redundant downloads by checking the local file system before attempting to download again.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Criteria for Success:\n",
    "- Different URLs must map to different files, even if they belong to the same domain. This can be achieved by generating a unique filename using a hash function (e.g., `md5`).\n",
    "- Binary files (e.g., images) must be handled correctly without corruption. This requires proper file handling, ensuring binary write operations for non-text artifacts.\n",
    "- Artifacts that are already stored locally should not be downloaded again. The caching system should check for the existence of a file before re-downloading it.\n",

Smithsonian photo by Eric Long. Pictured above are foam pointed ear tips that Leonard Nimoy wore in his role as Spock in the original 1960s Star Trek TV series, which aired on NBC from 1966 until 1969. Nimoy brought the prosthetics home as a personal memento of his role as the half-human, half-Vulcan science officer on the starship Enterprise. Until his death in 2015, the ear tips were displayed in Nimoy’s home in a box he made. Donated to the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum by Nimoy’s children Adam and Julie and the Nimoy family, they are now on display in the museum’s Kenneth C. Griffin Exploring the Planets Gallery. Watch a video of the unboxing of the ear tips , read more about them , and view the museum’s Enterprise model that was also used in the original series. The ear tips were a gift of the Nimoy Family, in honor of Beit T'Shuvah and the Leonard Nimoy COPD Research Fund at UCLA.

    "### Task 3: Summarizing Smithsonian Snapshots\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.0.3. Task Description\n",
    "You will analyze the text content from one of the Smithsonian Snapshot pages, such as [How Very Logical](https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/snapshot/how-very-logical). Your task is to extract and analyze the text content from this page, focusing on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract key phrases (`get_word_stats() -> Counter`)**: Use basic natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify the most frequently used words from the main body of the text. All words should be converted to lowercase, and a frequency distribution of the words should be generated using a `Counter` object.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Sentence Segmentation (`split_into_sentences() -> None`)**: Split the cleaned text into individual sentences, ensuring that punctuation is handled correctly. The sentences should be stored as a list of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cleaning and Normalization (`clean_text(html_content: bytes) -> None`)**: Clean the text to remove any extraneous characters, symbols, or whitespace. This involves normalizing the text by converting it to lowercase and removing special characters like punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "1. **Word Frequency Analysis**: Implement a method (`get_word_stats()`) to count the frequency of each word in the page content. Ensure all words are converted to lowercase for consistency in counting, and return the word frequencies as a `Counter` object.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Sentence Splitting**: Implement a method (`split_into_sentences()`) to split the content into individual sentences, ensuring punctuation and line breaks are handled properly. The resulting sentences should be stored in a list.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Cleaning and Normalization**: Implement a method (`clean_text(html_content: bytes)`) to clean the text by removing any special characters and unnecessary whitespace, while also normalizing the text by converting it to lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Criteria for Success:\n",
    "- The `get_word_stats()` method should return a frequency distribution of words as a `Counter` object, ensuring accurate word counting by normalizing to lowercase.\n",
    "- Sentences should be extracted cleanly from the page’s main text using the `split_into_sentences()` method.\n",

    "### Task 4: Building a Smithsonian Snapshots Crawler\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.0.4. Task Description\n",
    "In this task, you will create a **web crawler** that will start at the Smithsonian Snapshots page and follow links to gather and analyze the content from multiple snapshot pages. The Smithsonian Snapshot section contains multiple articles, and your crawler will explore these articles, download their content, and process the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will implement a web crawler that:\n",
    "1. Starts at the [Smithsonian Snapshots Page](https://www.si.edu/snapshot).\n",
    "2. Crawls through snapshot pages, extracting key information (links, images, and text) from each page.\n",
    "3. Follows links from the initial page to other snapshot articles up to a specified depth.\n",
    "4. Processes and stores the content from each crawled page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "1. **Implement a Crawler (`crawl(url: str, depth: int = 0) -> None`)**: Start crawling from the [Smithsonian Snapshots Page](https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/snapshots), gather links to snapshot articles, and visit each article. The method should be recursive, handling different crawl depths, and visiting pages only once.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Content Extraction (`extract_content(html_content: bytes, base_url: str) -> Dict[str, Optional[str]]`)**: For each visited page, extract the following:\n",
    "   - Anchor tags (`'link_text', 'absolute_url'`).\n",
    "   - Image URLs (absolute URLs).\n",
    "   - Cleaned text content from the body of the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Depth Control (`max_depth: int`)**: Implement a parameter to control the depth of the crawl (i.e., how many levels of links the crawler should follow). Ensure that the crawler respects the specified depth and doesn’t exceed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Yield Results (`crawl_generator() -> Generator[Dict[str, Optional[str]], None, None]`)**: Your crawler should return a **generator** that yields the results (text, links, images) as soon as a page is processed. This should allow the results to be streamed rather than collected all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Criteria for Success:\n",
    "- The crawler should respect the specified depth and only crawl the specified number of levels.\n",
    "- Each snapshot page should have its content (links, images, text) extracted and returned in a structured format (i.e., as a dictionary).\n",
    "- The crawler should handle relative links and convert them to absolute URLs.\n",
    "- The content should be cleaned and stored properly, and the crawler should only revisit each URL once to avoid redundancy.\n",
    "- Ensure the total number of visited links doesn't exceed 10, as long runtimes may result in penalties.\n",
